AMR: Hi my name is ......

R: Hey guys this bootcamp has been brutal, what are you guys doing after we graduate?

A: I was actually planning on doing some gaming, I've been holding off on getting any new games since I've been busy with this bootcamp. How about you Matt?

M: Yeah, I actually heard that some LHL students have created a new website for buying and selling games.

R: Oh do you mean GAMR? I'm actually looking to buy a new game. Do you guys want to check it out?

A&M: YEAH!!

R: Welcome to GAMR! A site where you can buy and sell games as a user or admin. 

#  R: why don't we show them what a user can do Matt.


# mAtT / Users
1. users can see featured items on a main feed
2. users can filter items by price,

3. users can favourite items to check up on them later


4. users can send messages to the user that is listing the item

# M: Ray I think I want to buy super smash bros. Can you send an email to the seller?
  
# R: *Write an email to the seller*

Hey, I want to buy this game.
Thanks,
Ray.

# R: *Show that the seller has received the email*

# aLdWiN / Admins
1. send a message via app, email, or text back on negotiations in buying the said item
- Looks like I got an email....
2. mark items as SOLD!,
- once I sell a game, I go back a mark the game as sold to let other users know 
3. post items, which can be seen by others
- this will be how I would enter in games that I want to sell...
# - Name, description, price, url --- for new game to be added/create listing
#  - CyberPunk, nice game, $39.99, ----url link-----
4. remove items from the site
- actually I'm going to keep this game.. better remove it...

# A: Well it looks like that's all I need to do for now. Aldwin leaves (LITERALLY)..


### ending 
R: ..that wraps up our presentation. For the midterm experience as a whole, 
I learned a lot about the github workflow and working with others. 
I enjoyed the front end part more than the back end, it was nice to make things to look the way we wanted.
how about you Matt?

M: ..M
fun fact: our site name is an acronym for games + all of our first initials, cool eh.
